# Reviews-of-Vibrating-Gloves-for-Parkinsons

On December 13, 2022, The Today Show aired an amazing story about Dr. Tass's Stanford Gloves for the treatment of Parkinsons. (See, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEEwbxFT4Bc ).  The gloves worked to relieve many of the symptoms of PD through stimulating the brain non-invasively with gentle vibrational pulses administered in a special sequence to the wearer's fingertips.  The story immediately created great excitement and hope for people with Parkinsons and their supporters everywhere.  

Given that the availability of Dr. Tass's treatment was projected to be some years into the future, engineers with PD and their supporters around the world began intense local DIY efforts to replicate the Stanford Gloves based on the specifications provided in Dr. Tass's numerous research papers.  These DIY developers shared ideas and designs on the web through various PD forums, websites, and YouTube posts.   

This free pdf document is an effort by two of the many developers involved in the DIY PD glove movement to: 

1. Suggest a set of standard criteria for reviewing DIY designs.
2.  Begin a collection of DIY designs by presenting a few reviews of different types of DIY designs that are currently available.   
3.  Demonstrate how the vibrational performance of DIY gloves can be bench tested and compared.  
4.  Suggest a standard format for providing user feedback and provide some initial reviews from vibrating PD glove users.  

In presenting this document, we are not advocating for any particular glove design.  Likewise, we are not advocating for people with Parrkinsons to use DIY glove therapy.  The informed choices of whether to proceed with a DIY glove, and if so what design to choose, should be made by each individual in consideration of their personal circumstances and disposition, and only after consultation with their doctors.  This is particularly true for people who have DBS or pacemakers and have to consider special precautions around all electronics.
